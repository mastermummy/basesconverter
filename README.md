Thank you for checking out my program! The function of this program should be fairly self-explanatory, but below is a guide: 

Run basesconverter.exe:

Number (Field 1): Enter the number that you would like to convert. Decimals are supported. 

From base (Field 2): Enter the base that the number is currently in. This must be an integer >=2 and <=36. Ensure that your number does not include illegal digits for its base. Ex: 162 contains an illegal "6" for a base of 2

To base (Field 3): Enter the base for the output. This must be an integer >=2 and <=36.

Your converted number will appear at the bottom, and you can copy it by clicking the "Copy to Clipboard" button.
